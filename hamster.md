Hamsters are small, nocturnal rodents commonly kept as pets. Native to the Middle East, they are known for their cute appearance, short limbs, and distinctive cheek pouches, which they use to store food. Hamsters are typically solitary animals, and they can be quite active, running on wheels or burrowing in their bedding.

Hamsters are low-maintenance pets, making them popular for first-time pet owners or those living in smaller spaces. Their diet consists mainly of seeds, vegetables, and fresh water, and they enjoy a variety of enrichment activities. While they are generally friendly, hamsters can become stressed if handled too frequently or roughly. Despite their small size, hamsters can live up to 2â€“3 years in captivity and are loved for their playful and curious nature.
