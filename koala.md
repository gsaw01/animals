The koala is a beloved marsupial native to Australia, easily recognized by its fluffy ears, large black 
nose, and soft gray fur. Often mistakenly called a “koala bear,” it’s not a bear at all but a 
marsupial, meaning it carries its young in a pouch. Koalas live in eucalyptus forests, where they spend 
most of their time perched in trees, feeding on eucalyptus leaves.

Their diet is low in nutrients, so koalas conserve energy by sleeping up to 20 hours a day. They are 
solitary animals, with each koala maintaining its own home range within the forest. Koalas are a 
national symbol of Australia and are cherished worldwide for their gentle and endearing nature. 
However, they face significant threats from habitat loss, disease, and climate change, making 
conservation efforts crucial to their survival.
