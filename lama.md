The lama is a domesticated animal native to the Andes Mountains in South America, known for its long 
neck, thick wool, and expressive face. As a relative of camels, lamas belong to the camelid family, but 
they lack humps. They were domesticated thousands of years ago by the Indigenous peoples of the Andes 
and have been used for transport, wool, and companionship ever since.

Lamas are hardy animals well-suited to high altitudes and rough terrain. They are known for their calm 
and social nature but can be quite opinionated—if annoyed, they’re infamous for spitting as a form of 
communication or defense. Their wool is soft and lanolin-free, making it hypoallergenic and ideal for 
textiles.
