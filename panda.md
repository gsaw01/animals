The panda is a charming and iconic animal, best known for its unique black-and-white fur. Native to 
China, pandas live in bamboo forests where their diet consists almost entirely of bamboo, making up 
about 99% of what they eat. Even though pandas are part of the bear family, their plant-based diet sets 
them apart from other bears.

Pandas are solitary creatures, spending most of their time eating or resting. While they seem slow and 
peaceful, they can move surprisingly quickly when needed. They’ve become a global symbol of 
conservation, representing efforts to protect endangered species and habitats. As China’s national 
treasure, pandas hold a special place in the hearts of people all over the world for their gentle 
nature and adorable appearance.
